# DID Manager Library

## Overview

The **DID Manager Library** is a comprehensive TypeScript-based solution tailored for developers aiming to implement robust Decentralized Identifier (DID) management within digital wallets and decentralized applications (dApps). In the evolving landscape of digital identity, DIDs play a crucial role by providing users with sovereign and secure identifiers that are not reliant on centralized authorities. This library streamlines the processes involved in creating, managing, and securing multiple DIDs, ensuring that developers can integrate decentralized identity functionalities with ease and confidence.

### What is a Decentralized Identifier (DID)?

A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a globally unique identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. Unlike traditional identifiers (like email addresses or usernames), DIDs are not tied to any central authority, providing users with greater control over their personal data and identity verification processes. Each DID is associated with a pair of cryptographic keys—a public key and a private key—which are essential for secure interactions and authentications in decentralized environments.

### Why DID Manager Library?

Managing multiple DIDs involves intricate processes, including secure key generation, encryption, storage, and retrieval. The **DID Manager Library** abstracts these complexities, offering a streamlined and secure way to handle multiple DIDs within a single wallet. Whether you're building a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, a digital identity wallet, or any application requiring decentralized identities, this library provides the foundational tools necessary for effective DID management.

## Features

The **DID Manager Library** is equipped with a suite of features designed to address the multifaceted needs of decentralized identity management. Below is an in-depth exploration of its core functionalities:

### 1. **Multiple DID Management**

- **Creation of Multiple DIDs**: Easily generate and manage multiple DIDs within a single wallet. This is particularly useful for applications that require distinct identities for different purposes or transactions.
- **Organized Storage**: Each DID is stored with its unique attributes, ensuring organized and efficient management. Developers can categorize and handle DIDs based on specific criteria or use cases.

- **Scalable Solutions**: Designed to handle a growing number of DIDs without compromising performance or security, making it suitable for both small-scale and enterprise-level applications.

### 2. **Secure Key Generation**

- **Ed25519 Elliptic Curve**: Utilizes the Ed25519 elliptic curve for generating cryptographic key pairs. Ed25519 is renowned for its security and performance, providing strong protection against various cryptographic attacks.
- **Asynchronous Key Generation**: Leverages asynchronous operations to generate keys without blocking the main execution thread, ensuring a smooth user experience even during intensive cryptographic processes.

- **Unique Key Pairs per DID**: Each DID is backed by its own unique public and private key pair, ensuring that the compromise of one key does not affect the security of others.

### 3. **Data Encryption**

- **AES-CBC Encryption**: Implements the Advanced Encryption Standard in Cipher Block Chaining (AES-CBC) mode to encrypt private keys. AES-CBC is a widely trusted encryption standard that provides robust security for sensitive data.

- **Initialization Vector (IV) Generation**: Generates a unique Initialization Vector (IV) for each encryption operation, enhancing security by ensuring that identical plaintexts produce different ciphertexts.

- **Secure Storage of Encrypted Data**: Encrypted private keys are stored securely, preventing unauthorized access and ensuring that even if storage is compromised, the keys remain protected.

### 4. **Persistent Storage**

- **IndexedDB Integration**: Utilizes IndexedDB, a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This ensures that DID identities are stored persistently and remain accessible across browser sessions.

- **Well-Defined Database Schema**: Defines a clear and efficient schema for storing DIDs, including indexing mechanisms to facilitate quick retrieval and management.

- **Reliable Data Management**: Ensures data integrity and reliability, minimizing the risk of data loss or corruption through robust storage practices.

### 5. **Unique Identification**

- **UUID Generation**: Generates universally unique identifiers (UUIDs) for each DID identity, ensuring that every identity is distinct and easily identifiable within the system.

- **Conflict Prevention**: The use of UUIDs eliminates the possibility of identifier collisions, maintaining the uniqueness and integrity of each DID.

- **Traceability**: Facilitates easy tracking and management of DIDs through their unique IDs, aiding in debugging, auditing, and monitoring processes.

### 6. **TypeScript Support**

- **Strong Typing**: Provides comprehensive TypeScript type definitions, enhancing code reliability and reducing runtime errors by catching type-related issues during development.

- **Enhanced Developer Experience**: Leverages TypeScript’s features like interfaces and type annotations to offer a more intuitive and error-resistant coding environment.

- **Seamless Integration**: Compatible with TypeScript projects, allowing developers to integrate the library without facing type mismatches or compatibility issues.

### 7. **Web Crypto API Integration**

- **High-Performance Cryptographic Operations**: Leverages the Web Crypto API for performing secure and efficient cryptographic tasks, ensuring that encryption and decryption processes are both fast and reliable.

- **Standardized Security Practices**: Aligns with modern web security standards, ensuring that the cryptographic operations meet industry best practices.

- **Browser Compatibility**: Utilizes APIs that are widely supported across modern browsers, ensuring broad compatibility and functionality.
