# DID Manager Library

## Overview

The **DID Manager Library** is a comprehensive TypeScript-based solution tailored for developers aiming to implement robust Decentralized Identifier (DID) management within digital wallets and decentralized applications (dApps). In the evolving landscape of digital identity, DIDs play a crucial role by providing users with sovereign and secure identifiers that are not reliant on centralized authorities. This library streamlines the processes involved in creating, managing, and securing multiple DIDs, ensuring that developers can integrate decentralized identity functionalities with ease and confidence.

### What is a Decentralized Identifier (DID)?

A Decentralized Identifier (DID) is a globally unique identifier that enables verifiable, decentralized digital identity. Unlike traditional identifiers (like email addresses or usernames), DIDs are not tied to any central authority, providing users with greater control over their personal data and identity verification processes. Each DID is associated with a pair of cryptographic keys—a public key and a private key—which are essential for secure interactions and authentications in decentralized environments.

### Why DID Manager Library?

Managing multiple DIDs involves intricate processes, including secure key generation, encryption, storage, and retrieval. The **DID Manager Library** abstracts these complexities, offering a streamlined and secure way to handle multiple DIDs within a single wallet. Whether you're building a decentralized finance (DeFi) platform, a digital identity wallet, or any application requiring decentralized identities, this library provides the foundational tools necessary for effective DID management.

## Features

The **DID Manager Library** is equipped with a suite of features designed to address the multifaceted needs of decentralized identity management. Below is an in-depth exploration of its core functionalities:

### 1. **Multiple DID Management**

- **Creation of Multiple DIDs**: Easily generate and manage multiple DIDs within a single wallet. This is particularly useful for applications that require distinct identities for different purposes or transactions.
- **Organized Storage**: Each DID is stored with its unique attributes, ensuring organized and efficient management. Developers can categorize and handle DIDs based on specific criteria or use cases.

### 2. **Secure Key Generation**

- **Ed25519 Elliptic Curve**: Utilizes the Ed25519 elliptic curve for generating cryptographic key pairs. Ed25519 is renowned for its security and performance, providing strong protection against various cryptographic attacks.

### 3. **Persistent Storage**

- **IndexedDB Integration**: Utilizes IndexedDB, a low-level API for client-side storage of significant amounts of structured data, including files/blobs. This ensures that DID identities are stored persistently and remain accessible across browser sessions.

- **Well-Defined Database Schema**: Defines a clear and efficient schema for storing DIDs, including indexing mechanisms to facilitate quick retrieval and management.
